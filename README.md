# Sonar Detection Project with Arduino, Processing, Servo Motor, Ultrasonic Sensor, and Buzzer

This project integrates Arduino, Processing IDE, a servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, and buzzer to create an interactive system for object detection inspired by sonar technology. 

## Overview

At its core, an Arduino microcontroller manages the system's operations. Connected components include a servo motor, ultrasonic sensor, and buzzer, each playing a critical role in the detection process.

## Components

- **Arduino Microcontroller**: Manages system operations.
- **Servo Motor**: Rotates to enable the sensor to scan different directions.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Emits high-frequency sound waves and measures echo return times for precise distance calculations.
- **Buzzer**: Emits an audible alert when an object is detected.

## Functionality

Mounted on a rotating servo motor, the ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves and measures the time taken for echoes to return from objects, providing precise distance calculations and proximity information. The servo motor facilitates sweeping motion, expanding the detection area.

When an object is detected, the ultrasonic sensor signals the Arduino, triggering the buzzer to emit an audible alert.

## Visualization

Processing IDE creates graphical representations of the sonar detection process. It receives data from Arduino via serial communication and generates real-time visualizations, including graphs and animations depicting object positions and distances.

## Applications

This sonar detection project offers a versatile solution for various applications, including security systems, obstacle avoidance mechanisms, and interactive installations, showcasing innovation in object detection and visualization. 

## Usage

1. Connect the components as per the provided instructions.
2. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller.
3. Run the Processing IDE sketch to visualize the detection process.
